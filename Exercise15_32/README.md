Control Clock program using Java FX that displays a clock showing the current time (seconds, minutes, hours) that is animated and you can see the three hands of the clock moving


## Example Output

![pic]README.jpg


## Analysis Steps

Modify listing 14.21 so that it is animated and shows the three hands of the clock moving. Add two methods to start and stop the clock that lets the user control the clock.


### Design

Used one class for Clock Pane


### Testing

Clock displays in pane
Clock hands all three display
Clock hands move clockwise
Clock hands move to correct second, minute, hour locations on clock
Stop button stops the animation on clock hands
Start button resumes animation of clock hands
```


## Notes

Had issues getting the start button to resume animation at the same location the clock hands were stopped at.
