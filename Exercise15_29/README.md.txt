# Project Title

Racing Car Java FX program that races a car from left to right and repeats back on the left when car moves out of view from the user. The user can also interact with the racing car by clickign their mouse button to stop the car (release mouse button to resume) as well as use the up and down arrow keys to control the speed of the car.

## Analysis Steps



Program that loops a car from the left to right side of the window. When the car reaches the right side of the window it continues from the left side and so on. Mouse button presses should pause the animation, and car speed should be controlled using the Up and Down arrow keys. 

### Design

How did you approach your program design? Did you use multiple classes to define various objects?

```
Give examples
```

### Testing
Car displays in pane.
Car movies left to right.
Car leaves right side of screen and continues on left side.
Animation is paused when mouse click is pressed down.
Animation resumes on mouse button upstroke.
Animation speed increases by 1 each time Up Arrow is pressed.
Animation speed is decreased by 1 each time the Down Arrow is pressed.
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Notes

Having issues with stage and scene with the animation pane.
